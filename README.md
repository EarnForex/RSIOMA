# RSIOMA

RSIOMA is a custom MT4/MT5 indicator coded by EarnForex.com. The indicator is based on an earlier version by _Kalenzo_. RSIOMA shows the RSI of two moving averages and then calculates the MA of the resulting RSI.

RSIOMA can issue all sorts of alerts based on the expected and actual trend changes.
